# Temperature-controlled-cooling

In this project I am trying to continuously send my PC's CPU temperature to raspberry pi which will then process the temperature and decide what RPM the connected fan needs to be shifted.

Raspberry pi will be reading the RPM value off the digital signal (third pin) of the fan and the raspberry pi will adjust the potentiometer to reduce or increase the speed of the fan.
